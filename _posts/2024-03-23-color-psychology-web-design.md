Color is one of the most powerful tools in a web designer's arsenal. It can evoke emotions, influence decisions, and create memorable user experiences. Understanding color psychology is essential for creating effective web designs that resonate with your target audience.

## The Impact of Color on User Behavior

Colors have a profound effect on how users perceive and interact with websites. Research shows that users make subconscious judgments about a website within 90 seconds, and up to 90% of that assessment is based on color alone. This is why choosing the right color scheme is crucial for your website's success.
