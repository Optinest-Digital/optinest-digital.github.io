## Why SEO Matters

Search engine optimization (SEO) is more than just ranking on Google. It's about:

- **Increasing organic traffic**: Unlike paid ads, SEO drives consistent traffic over time without ongoing ad spend.
- **Building trust and credibility**: Ranking on the first page signals authority to your audience.
- **Improving user experience**: SEO ensures your site loads fast, is easy to navigate, and provides relevant content.
- **Driving higher conversion rates**: Visitors from search engines are actively looking for solutions — making them more likely to convert.
- **Reducing acquisition cost**: SEO is a long-term investment that delivers compounding returns.
